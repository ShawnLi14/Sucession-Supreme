        <h1>How to Play</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the game! Your goal is to build a climax community by carefully selecting and planting different plants.</p>
        
        <h2>Game Interface</h2>
        <p>The game interface consists of the following elements:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Goal Indicator:</strong> Located on the top left of the screen, the goal indicator shows your progress towards the next phase of succession.</li>
          <li><strong>Nutrient Level and Soil Percentage:</strong> Displayed on the top right of the screen, these indicators show the current nutrient level and soil percentage in the ecosystem.</li>
          <li><strong>Plots:</strong> You can click on the plots in the game to plant different plants and contribute to the ecosystem's development.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Building a Climax Community</h2>
        <p>To build a climax community, follow these steps:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Select a plot by clicking on it.</li>
          <li>Choose a plant from the available options.</li>
          <li>Each plant will have a different nutrient cost.</li>
          <li>Repeat the process for other plots until you've created a diverse and stable climax community.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Remember to balance the different plant species and their needs to maintain a sustainable ecosystem. Be careful for droughts, which may make some plots uninhabitable for a period of time.</p>
